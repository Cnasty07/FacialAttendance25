# Old User Interface

Keeping the old user interface in this folder to show differences and progress done. Will delete when this class is over.

## Why?

1. To show the changes from the first version to the second one.
2. While developing, to keep track of refactoring changes and fix issues if needed.

## Future

Will delete after presentation.
