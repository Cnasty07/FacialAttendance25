class Capture:
    """
    Summary:
        The Capture class provides functionality to capture video and images using OpenCV. 
        It supports three capture methods: 'video', 'image', and 'stored'. The 'video' method 
        captures video frames continuously until the user stops it, the 'image' method captures 
        a single image, and the 'stored' method is used for testing purposes to return a stored image.
    Methods:
        __init__(capture_method: str):
            Initializes the Capture object and starts the appropriate capture method based on the input parameter.
        start_video_capture():
            Captures video frames from the default camera, displays them in a window, and saves the last frame 
            as an image file with a timestamp. The video capture stops when the user presses the 'q' key.
        start_image_capture():
            Captures a single image from the default camera, displays it in a window, and saves it as an image 
            file with a timestamp.
        start_return_image():
            Returns a stored image for testing purposes.
